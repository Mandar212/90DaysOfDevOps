# Day 01 – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud

## Task
Today’s goal is to **set the foundation for your DevOps journey**.

You will create a **90-day personal DevOps learning plan** that clearly defines:
- What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
    -> I think devops is a kind of infrastucture development whichh is done for  different kinds of applications. This is closely coulped with actual development team to understand the requirement of resources, the load of customers and specfifc app related tool required. 
    -> Defination : Devops is a set of cultural philosophies, practives and tools that combines software development and it operations DEV+OPS to shorten the development lifecycle, increase development freq and deliver high quality software.
    -> Core practices : CI , CD , Infrastucture as code (IaC), monitoreing and logging.

    -> Cloud engg : As enterprises / apps are want to scale at a large level wihtout inventsing le large capex, the only solution comes out to be cloud computing. It has many advantages -  no maintainance, larger scaling capacity, reliable, more reach, lesser capital investment, faster accquring, broader usecases.

- Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
    -> Currentl I am working at Amdocs in field of Mainframe which is now shrinking  and I also don't really like working in the field and same team. So to switch my domain I am studying devops and cloud.

- Where do you want to reach?
-> In long term I want to reach at a level where I am the centerstage of a org of devops role. In short term I want to switch my domain in DevOps and get new job.
- How you will stay consistent every single day?
    -> My wH are 0100 to 2200. I can reach office by 9
    -> Everyday I feel the pain of working in the field which does not give me fllfillment, a team which does not give inclusion
